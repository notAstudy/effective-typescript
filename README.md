# Hello, Effective TypeScript
We plan to read [Effective Typescript](https://effectivetypescript.com/)

## Why we read
### To talk about good and bad habit
This book introduces some cases that are not good and suggest alternatives. With that suggestion, we can talk about whether or not we need to change our coding habit. By exchanging opinions, we expect to choose good habits and try them when we code.

### To understand better
Sometimes, we use some features of TypeScript without sufficient understanding. It would make reasoning harder when something were broken with complex logic. By understanding TypeScript better, we think we can reduce reasoning area. So, we can focus on finding the actual reason, with comparably little concern of TypeScript thing.
